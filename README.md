Carrot is an easy-to-use, real-time framework for building applications with multi-device AR capabilities. It works using WebSockets, Golang, client libraries written for iOS, and a unique location tracking system based on iBeacons that we aptly named The Picnic Protocol. Using Carrot, multi-device AR apps can be created with high accuracy location tracking to provide rich and lifelike experiences. To see for yourself, check out Scribbles, a multiplayer drawing application made with Carrot. You can see a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVtb0pJPgk) and the code [here](https://github.com/carrot-ar/scribbles).

## Building an application with Carrot

Building applications with Carrot is incredibly simple. Check out this echo application that echos a payload from one device into the AR space of all connected devices: 

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/carrot-ar/carrot"
)

// Controller declaration
type EchoController struct{}

//Controller method implementation
func (c *EchoController) Echo(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	message, err := carrot.CreateDefaultResponse(req)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	br.Broadcast(message)
}

func main() {

	// Register endpoint by providing endpoint, controller, and method, and if endpoint requires streaming
	carrot.Add("echo", EchoController{}, "Echo", true)

	// Run the server to handle traffic
	carrot.Run()
}
```
The example above ommits extra functionality to showcase the basic components required to connect carrot to your application. The required components are the following:

* Import inclusion
* Controller declaration
* Controller method(s) implementation
* Main method that
	* Registers connections between methods and controllers for Carrot to route and maintain
	* Runs the Carrot server
	
Controller methods receieve requests and broadcast responses to clients. Requests can be passed as-is, demonstrated with the CreateDefaultResponse method above, or information can be appended before responses are broadcasted.

To make the framework interact with platform-specific code, developers will need to implement the Carrot client framework. Currently, only iOS support exists. To see how to do so, visit the carrot-ios repository [https://github.com/carrot-ar/carrot-ios](https://github.com/carrot-ar/carrot-ios)

## Message Format

Carrot has two message types: request and responses. These are represented by the []byte type.

Requests are created and sent by the client framework to the server framework. Conversely, responses are created and sent by a developer defined controller back to the client framework. The end of a request's path marks the beginning of the corresponding response's path. 

The structure of messages are identical, so the two types of messages represent the opposite directions (and ultimate paths) data travels. Requests and responses are in the form of the following JSON:

	{
		"session_token": "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F",
		"endpoint": "echo",
		"payload": {
			"offset": {
				"x": 3.2,
				"y": 1.3,
				"z": 4.0
			},
			"params": {
				"foo": "bar"
			}
		}
	}

## Sending Messages to Carrot

Carrot expects to recieve requests from clients.

In order for a client to send messages to other devices, a route must be defined so the server knows the destination controller and method to handle the incoming requests. Consider this example application snippet:

``` go
// Controller declaration
type ExampleController struct{}

//Controller method implementation
func (c *ExampleController) PrintFooParameterToConsole(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	fmt.Println(req.Params["foo"])
}

func main() {
  	// Register endpoint by providing endpoint, controller, and method, and if endpoint requires streaming
	carrot.Add("print_foo_param", ExampleController{}, "PrintFooParameterToConsole", true)
}
```

In order to send a message to this endpoint, all we need to do is specify the endpoint in our request. A request to be sent to the endpoint defined above could look something like this :

```
{
	"session_token": "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F",
	"endpoint": "print_foo_param",
	"payload": {
		"offset": {
			"x": 3,
			"y": 1,
			"z": 4
		},
		"params": {
			"foo": "bar"
		}
	}
}
```

If this request is sent to the server over the WebSocket connection established, it will create a new instance of the `ExampleController` and route the message to the `PrintFooParameterToConsole` function. Inside the function, we will log the value of the `foo` parameter to the server log. 

Once the request reached its intended controller method, it has reached the end of its life cycle.

## Receiving Messages from Carrot

Clients can expect to receive responses from Carrot. Assuming the request is not explicitly modified in the developer-defined controller, then the response should be exactly the same as the request. 

In the case that the developer wants to modify requests before the devices are broadcasted and recieve these responses, custom responses can be built.

### Responses

There are two different types of responses: default and custom.

#### Default Responses

If the developer wants to forward requests as they are, then they can use the create a default response. The following snippet shows how to create a default response:

``` go

func (c *ExampleController) CreateDefaultResponse(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	defaultResponse, err := carrot.CreateDefaultResponse(req)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
}

```

As you can see above, the contents of the request received by the controller are dumped into the generating the contents of the new response. Behind the scenes, the JSON representing the message stucture is created and returned as a []byte ready to be broadcasted. Once created, a default reponse cannot be modified. This option is therefore used for sake of brevity in relevant use cases.

#### Custom Responses

If the developer wants to add extra information to the message, then a custom response must be created.  Like the default response, the contents are the request are placed in the response. However, the custom response requires the developer to explictly call more functions to create it. 

The first two functions define the contents for all of the fields that are copied from the request. 

``` go 

func (c *EchoController) EchoExtendable(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	token := string(req.SessionToken)
	payload, err := carrot.NewPayload(token, req.Offset, req.Params)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	res, err := carrot.NewResponse(token, "Echo", payload)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	...
}

```

The next and most interesting functions to note are the `AddParam` and `AddParams` functions. They allow the developer to append key-value pairs to a custom response.

``` go

func (c *EchoController) EchoExtendable(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	...
	oneFishTwoFish := ResponseParams{"red": "fish", "blue": "fish"}
	res.AddParam("someKey", "someValue")
	res.AddParams(oneFishTwoFish)
	...
}
	
```

Finally, a custom response must be packaged into a JSON object. 

``` go

func (c *EchoController) EchoExtendable(req *carrot.Request, br *carrot.Broadcast) {
	...
	message, err := res.Build()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	...
}
	
```

The resulting message is ready to be broadcasted to clients and can no longer be modified.

## Broadcasting Responses

The broadcast module, available in all controller implementations, has a few options for narrowing down which clients to send a message to. Since all clients have a session associated with them, there is a 1-to-1 relationship between sessions and clients. Thus, every client has a `SessionToken` which is accessible within the client and within the session store internal to Carrot. 

#### Broadcasting to all clients

``` go
carrot.Broadcast(/* carrot response  */)
```

#### Broadcasting to a subset of clients

``` go
carrot.Broadcast(/* carrot response */, sessionToken1, sessiontoken2)
```
or
``` go
recipients := []string{sessionToken1, sessionToken2, sessionToken3)
carrot.Broadcast(/* carrot response */, recipients)
```

One way to make the best use of this feature is to keep sessions associated with users in a datastore connected to carrot. Then, a simple query can return a set of sessions that should be sent a response. Here is some pseudocode demonstrating this:
``` go
func (c *ExampleController) SendHelloToAll(r *carrot.Request, b *carrot.Broadcast) {
	/* build up a response here */
	/* database call to get a list of session tokens based on a query */
	b.Broadcast(/* response */, /* array with session tokens */)
}
```

Once the response reaches its intended recipient(s), it has reached the end of its life cycle.

## Sessions

Maintaining the state of clients are done using sessions inside of Carrot. Due to the shared, concurrent access of sessions throughout the lifecycle of a request, they are stored isnide of Golang's `sync.Map`. An interface is provided such that future extensibility could be easily integrated into Carrot to allow session storage within in-memory data stores like Redis. 

Within Carrot, the session store is maintained using a singleton pattern and within any point of carrot the current state of sessions is accessible by calling the `NewDefaultSessionManager()`, which returns a pointer to the `SessionStore` interface. See the GoDoc for the `SessionStore` interface and `DefaultSessionStore` struct for more details.
